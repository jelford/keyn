        This is a test page with some links on it
        <ul>
            <!-- 
                You might be wondering why they're called "a" and "s" instead 
                of "a" and "b". The reason is that there is an issue in the
                selenium chrome web driver where it doesn't seem to be translating
                non-standard keyboard inputs correctly. In particular, I use a
                workman keyboard, where "b" is in the position normally occupied
                by "t". So driver.actions().sendKeys("b").perform() results in
                Chrome receiving a "t" key event.

                "s" is on the same place in both the QWERTY and Workman layouts,
                so the issue goes away.
